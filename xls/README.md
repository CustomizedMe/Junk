# xls

### Intro :
Here we are trying to develop a command line interface which can simplify the process of modifying Excel files easy and fast.
The objectives of the script include :
> Develop simple commands for adding, deleting multiple rows and commands by their respective numbers.
> Commands must have options for specifying different conditions : like either to delete the entire row, or only few elements.
> At present, we are working with the limitation of only one workbook at a time.


### Requirements :
This script uses:
- python 3.5
- openpyxl 2.6

### Contributing :
- For any bugs/feature raise an issue. ( Start the issue with FEATURE or BUG )
