## Contribution Guidelines

This repository stores simple scripts, small projects and assignments that some of us come across in our college life. It is a collabaration of small projects and anyone is free to use and contribute to the projects. So, in order to keep the repo clean and readable for first timers, we would like to give some contribution guidelines to anyone contributing to this repo.

### General Guidelines :
1. Anyone who wants to contribute to the project - add a feature or have found some bugs in some of the existing projects must raise an issue first , and mention the changes they want. Once an issue is raised they can make PRs for the same, referencing the issue.
2. In case, some user wants to add small projects that don't fall in any of the categories/folder already present they should create a new directory add the required files in the directory and along with them should also add a __README__ file specific to that directory - explaining the working of the script and along with that should also add a short description of the project in the main readme file.

### Coding Guidelines :
>  __NOTE :__ It is not a  compulsion but it makes your easier to read.
- Use camel case for names of classes.
- Use snake case for function names.
- Use _{word}\_{word}... format for private function names.
> Rest is left on the discretion of the developer.
