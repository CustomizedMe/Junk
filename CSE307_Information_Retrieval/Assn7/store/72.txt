History[edit]
Corona station was opened in June 1983 along with Bay station when the LRT system was extended by 0.8Â km beneath Jasper Avenue from Central station.[3] The station was named after the Corona Hotel which was located on the current site of First Edmonton Place, an office tower directly above the station.[4] The station and First Edmonton Place both opened in 1983.

Corona station was the southern terminus of the LRT line prior to the opening of Grandin station in September 1989.

Due to the station name being synonymous with the 2019-2020 Coronavirus Pandemic, there have been some calls to rename the station after Alberta Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deena Hinshaw. 

Station layout[edit]
The station has a 123 metre long centre loading platform that can accommodate two five-car LRT trains at the same time, with one train on each side of the platform.  The platform is just over eight metres wide. Access to the platform is from the concourse level by stairs and escalators located at each end of the platform. Unlike other downtown stations, the concourse level at Corona is not connected to the Edmonton pedway system.[5]
